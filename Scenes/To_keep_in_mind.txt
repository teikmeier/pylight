Things to keep in mind regarding chases:

- chase_percentage = 8.3 means exactly one waving is moving along the 12-light LED bar.
- chase_percentage = 4.15 means exactly one waving is moving across both LED bars.
- chase_percentage = 16.67 means a double wave is moving across the 12-light LED bar.
- ....and so on.


To invert the direction of the chase wave:
- increase chase_shifts (starting values) by 100 (percent)
- make chase_percentage value negative (don't drop delays below 0!!!!)


For completely random "Funkeln":
- it's best so far to just just random values by hand.
- to keep the lights off for most of the time, it's good to set curve_min values in the strong negative (and min to 0)



Swirl typically means:
- sine wave across the LED bar (exactly one so chase_percentage = 8.3) but with following min, max settings:
	- max = curve_max = color values
	- min = curve_min = percentage of color values (eg. 25%)
